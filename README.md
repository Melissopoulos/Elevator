# Elevator

Overview:
This project simulates the behavior of an elevator system. It allows users to input the number of people on each
floor and their respective destination floors. The elevator then moves to fulfill these requests, considering the capacity and the number of floors.

Usage:
The elevator will prompt you to enter the number of people on each floor and their destination floors.
Input '0' to skip a floor.
The elevator will continue collecting input until it has processed all floors.

Configuration:
The number of floors and elevator capacity are randomly generated on startup.
The number of people and destination floors are provided by the user.

Run the project with node app.js
