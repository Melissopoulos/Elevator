Overview
This project simulates the behavior of an elevator system. It allows users to input the number of people on each
floor and their respective destination floors. The elevator then moves to fulfill these requests, considering the capacity and the number of floors.

Input '0' to skip a floor.
The elevator will continue collecting input until it has processed all floors.

Configuration
